  description = <b>Program: Experimental Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>For the Soviet Union, which occupies about one-sixth of the earth’s surface, an efficient system of space communications is a vital necessity. The country covers nearly 11 000 km from east to west and over 7200 km from north to south, and is crossed by 11 time zones; in addition, there are tremendously varied climatic conditions and vast areas of rugged terrain.
  synopsis = Provide two-way television for three months with 1% availability (~15 min per day) between Moscow and Vladivostok.
  notes = Earth stations with large tracking antennas have been built in Moscow and Vladivostok.
  completedMessage = The experiment has successfully demonstrated the viability of a space communications network for the Soviet Union, paving the way for an operational system.
