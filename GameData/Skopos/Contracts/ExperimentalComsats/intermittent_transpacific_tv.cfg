  title = Experimental Transpacific Television
  sortKey = 020
  description = The success of the transatlantic relay has sparked interest in Japan.
  synopsis = Provide transpacific television for three months with 1% availability (~15 min per day).
  notes = Earth stations with cutting-edge antennas have been built in the Kashima prefecture (Japan), and at Point Mugu (California). It should be possible to establish a transpacific link with a very small satellite.
  completedMessage = The experiment has successfully demonstrated the viability of a transpacific link via satellite, paving the way for a commercial operating system.
