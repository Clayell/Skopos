  title = Experimental Transpacific Telephony
  // Mostly pilfered from NASA SP-32 p. 740.
  description = For a Transpacific satellite telecom system to be viable, it must provide a sustained link, not just a few minutes until the satellite passes below the horizon. Provide a Transpacific connection that supports a few voice channels for at least 12 hours a day. The lower required data rate should allow a very small satellite to be used, opening up the possibility for higher orbits.
  synopsis = Provide Transpacific telephony for three months with 50% availability (~12 hours per day).
  notes = Earth stations with cutting-edge antennas have been built in the Kashima prefecture (Japan), and at Point Mugu (California). It should be possible to establish a transpacific link with a very small satellite.

  completedMessage = The experiment has successfully demonstrated the viability of a Transpacific link via satellite, paving the way for a commercial operating system.
