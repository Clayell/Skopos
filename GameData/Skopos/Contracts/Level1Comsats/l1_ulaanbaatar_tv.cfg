  title = Moscow-Ulaanbaatar Television - Level 1
  description = <b>Program: First Generation Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Mongolia is a close ally to the Soviet Union, but much like the eastern territories of the Soviet Union, it is sparsely populated and dominated by rugged terrain. Satellite telecommunication offers a way to easily provide TV to these remote areas.

  synopsis = Provide television service to Ulaanbaatar with 95% availability (~23 h per day) over a one year period.
  // From CIA ER IM 68-69, p. 4.
  completedMessage = About half a million viewers throughout the Mongolia can now watch 40 hours per week of live colour television broadcasts from Moscow.

  rewardReputation = 75		//this one is very easy, Ulaanbaatar is well within Molniya coverage
