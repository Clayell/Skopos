  description = <b>Program: First Generation Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=red>CAPSTONE</color></b><br><br>Your satellite communications network has allowed the world to be connected like never before, routing live TV broadcasts across continents and over oceans. To celebrate this achievement we would like to make a special TV broadcast involving live footage from dozens of countries across the world. You will need to provide a connection for about 3 months for shakedown testing before the broadcast. <br>Author's note: <i>Our World</i> was televised June 1967, although the Soviet Union pulled out 4 days before the broadcast in protest of the Six-Day War.
  notes = Earth stations with cutting-edge antennas have been built at Rosman and Brewster Flats to help relay the signal. Whether you achieve this with a MEO or LEO constellation or a single GEO satellite is up to you.
  synopsis = Provide global two-way telecom for three months with 95% availability (~23 h per day).
  completedMessage = The program has been a huge success, viewed by hundreds of millions around the world. With the power of satellite communications, our world has been brought closer than ever before.

  rewardReputation = 500	//kinda hard, capstone. Our World was viewed by nearly as many people as Apollo 11...
