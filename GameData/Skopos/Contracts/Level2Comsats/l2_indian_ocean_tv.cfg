  description = <b>Program: Second Generation Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>The first generation telecommunications satellite network has proven successful. However, demand is growing for satellite communication, and more countries want dedicated satellite links. Provide simultaneous links between Europe, Bahrain, Pakistan, Thailand and Australia
  notes = Earth Stations have been constructed in Si Racha (Thailand), Deh Mando (Pakistan), and Ras Abu Jarjur (Bahrain). Your satellite network will need the capacity to support 4 links at the same time. Whether you achieve this with a MEO or LEO constellation or a single GEO satellite is up to you.
  synopsis = Provide transpacific multi-access two-way telecom for one year with 95% availability (~23 h per day).
  completedMessage = Regular telecasts are now possible between the Indian Ocean region, Australia and Europe.
