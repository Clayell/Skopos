  description = <b>Program: Second Generation Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>We have successfully deployed satellite communications across the Soviet Union. However, we would also like the ability to directly broadcast to other Soviet-aligned states.
  notes = In addition to Naran (Mongolia), ground stations have been built in Neustrelitz (GDR), Sedlec-Prčice (Czechoslovakia), Taliándörögd (Hungary) and Plana (Bulgaria); while they have tracking dishes, these are receive-only; television will be broadcast from Moscow.
  synopsis = Provide television service to Soviet-aligned states with 95% availability (~23 h per day) over a one year period.
  completedMessage = Live television broadcasts from Moscow can now be viewed in Soviet-aligned states.
