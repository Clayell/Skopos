  title = Soviet Telecommunications - Level 2
  description = <b>Program: Second Generation Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>The first generation telecommunications satellite network has proven successful. However, we would like to improve bandwidth to utilize color television and improve quality. Further, we want be able to use satellite communications to relay information back to Moscow. Select stations across the Union have had transmission equipment installed. Improve the existing TV network while adding two-way voice capabilities.
  notes = In addition to Vladivostok, transmission equipment has been installed at Ashkhabad and Petropavlovsk.
  synopsis = Provide telecommunications service to the Soviet Union with 95% availability (~23 h per day) over a one year period. Your satellite network will need the capacity to support 4 links at the same time. Whether you achieve this with a MEO or LEO constellation or a single GEO satellite is up to you.
  completedMessage = About 10 million viewers throughout the Soviet Union can now watch 50 hours per week of live colour television broadcasts from Moscow. Additionally, telephone calls can now be supported all across the Union.
