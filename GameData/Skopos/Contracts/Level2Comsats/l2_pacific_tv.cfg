  description = <b>Program: Second Generation Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=green>Required</color></b><br><br>The first generation telecommunications satellite network has proven successful. However, demand is growing for satellite communication, and more countries want dedicated satellite links. Provide simultaneous links between North America, Japan, Taiwan, and Australia
  notes = Earth Stations have been constructed in Paumalu (Hawaii) and Yangmingshan (Taiwan). Your satellite network will need the capacity to support 4 links at the same time. Whether you achieve this with a MEO or LEO constellation or a single GEO satellite is up to you.
  synopsis = Provide transpacific multi-access two-way telecom for one year with 95% availability (~23 h per day).
  completedMessage = Regular telecasts are now possible between Japan, Taiwan, Australia and North America.
