  title = (PLACEHOLDER CONTRACT) Soviet Direct-to-Home Television - Level 1
  description = <b>Program: Third Generation Telecommunications Satellites (Skopos Beta)<br>Type: <color=blue>Optional</color></b><br><br>Although satellite communications have brought state TV to millions across the vast territories of the Soviet Union, large swathes of territory remain without coverage. Even with recent advances in telecommunications technology, the satellite earth stations required to track, recieve and demodulate signals from out existing satellite network are too expensive and complex to install in every village, hamlet and logging camp across the vast territories of Siberia. Instead, we would like to transmit TV signals directly from orbit, where they can be recieved with standard TV and radio equipment, bringing accessible television to the entire Union.
  notes = Rollout of new TV tuners and antennas has begun across the Soviet Union. These basic, TV Recieve-Only (TVRO) systems have no tracking capability so you will need to aim them at a point in the sky and ensure a satellite is always within their field of view. <br><color=orange>Author's note: TVRO stations currently function like any other ground station. This contract is just a placeholder until TVRO support is added.</color>
  synopsis = Provide remote telecom for 90 days with 95% availability (~23 h per day).
  completedMessage = The Soviet direct-to-home network can now provide state TV and radio service to anyone with a television or radio in the Soviet Union.
