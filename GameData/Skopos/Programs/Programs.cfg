	description = REQUIRES COMMS TL 3 (TRACKING STATION LEVEL 4) TO FUNCTION PROPERLY. Advances in satellite and rocket technology have made it possible to create a "microwave repeater in the sky", a satellite capable of recieving, amplifying, and retransmitting a signal from the ground. Construct and launch satellites to prove the ability of satellite communications to relay TV and voice channels.
