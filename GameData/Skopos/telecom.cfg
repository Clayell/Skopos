  description = The development of artificial satellites opens the possibility of applying microwave radio relay technology to transoceanic links, using a “microwave repeater in the sky”. The objective for this experiment is to answer the critical questions, leaving until a later round of design the optimization of trade-offs and the development and construction of a commercial operating system.
  synopsis = Provide transatlantic television for three months with 1% availability (~15 min per day).  Once this capability has been achieved, maintain a 1% monthly availability to allow for further experiments.
  notes = Earth stations with cutting-edge antennas have been built at Andover (Maine), Pleumeur-Bodou (Britanny), and Goonhilly Downs (Cornwall). It should be possible to establish a transatlantic link with a very small satellite.\nThe experimental transatlantic transmissions are mutually exclusive; while you must provide support for both westward and eastward television broadcasts, your satellite does not need to have the capacity for those to happen at the same time.

  completedMessage = The experiment has successfully demonstrated the viability of a transatlantic link via satellite, paving the way for a commercial operating system.
